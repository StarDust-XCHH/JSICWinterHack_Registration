### Project Experience

#### Autonomous Racing Robot (STM32 + ROS1)

June 2025 – October 2025: Solely responsible for full-stack development, including embedded firmware and ROS1 navigation stack. Implemented lidar-only SLAM using RPLIDAR C1 and IMU data; customized the local planner in move_base for high-speed go-and-return navigation. Designed a Bluetooth-based transparent communication architecture between STM32 and ROS host for sensor streaming and velocity command transmission.
